# Ship and Cargo Backend Platform

## Overview

The **Ship and Cargo Backend Platform** is a backend solution designed to streamline and optimize the process of matching dry bulk cargo with available ships. Built on Java Spring Boot with MyBatis for data access, and MySQL as the relational database, the platform addresses the complexities and unique demands of dry bulk cargo management at ports, offering users efficient and intelligent cargo-to-ship matching.

## Features

- **Cargo and Ship Management**: Allows users to add and manage both dry bulk cargo and ships, creating a centralized database of available transportation options.
- **Advanced Matching Algorithms**: Presents multiple optimal transportation options based on cargo requirements and ship availability, enabling users to make the best logistical choices.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Utilizes a microservices approach to invoke API calls, which enhances scalability, flexibility, and performance across various platform functions.
- **Industry Support**: Developed in collaboration with and supported by Cosco, a leader in global shipping, ensuring the platform meets industry standards and expectations.

## Technologies Used

- **Java Spring Boot**: Provides a robust framework for building production-ready applications with embedded server support and dependency injection.
